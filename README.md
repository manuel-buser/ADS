# 🧠 Algorithms and Data Structures (ADS)

This repository is a personal space for refreshing my knowledge of classic **algorithms** and **data structures**.

## 📂 What's inside

- Sorting algorithms (e.g. selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, ..)
- Step-by-step runtime analysis in code
- Python implementations for learning and experimenting
- Well-commented examples to visualize how algorithms work

✍️ Feel free to explore and learn with me!
